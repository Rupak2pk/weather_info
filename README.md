# Weather Information

A program that uses the national weather service api to get weather specific weather information and add them into an excel sheet for the user to said data


Optional python programs will also be created to use said datas in dictionarys rather than excels but excels were used just for the sake of it

There are two example excel files that show what the program will ouput. Rolla Missouri was sadly used as an example 
# How to use

Run the modules.py script to make sure you install all the python modules. Yes I know its very primitive and lazy but Ill work on it.


*Enter the latitude and longtitude of any place you desire
*Enter the amount of hours you would like to forecast (The max is till next week)

It will return forecast of however much time you would like to forsee

An example xlsx file was given in the respository to showcase what would be returned.


# Changelog
